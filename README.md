## TextExpander Snippets for creating HTML/CSS Wallpapers

### How to use:

* Open any HTML-Wallpaper???.txt file from this folder in a text editor.
* On your Mac computer, create a TextExpander snippet and copy-paste the code from the above file into it.
* Remember to save the snippet as a 'Shell Script'  
![Save as shell script option](./showcase-images/screenshot-shell-script-howto.jpg)
* Just run the script, and the browser should open with thus created wallpaper.
* You will see the word `%clipboard` in these snippets. It's the inbuilt Clipboard variable used by TextExpander.
* NOTE: All the images are generated randomly at the runtime of the snippet. Images courtesy: [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/?grid=multi)
