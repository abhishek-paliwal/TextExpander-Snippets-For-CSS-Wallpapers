## TextExpander Snippets for creating HTML/CSS Wallpapers

### How to use:

* Open any HTML-Wallpaper???.txt file
* On your Mac computer, create a TextExpander snippet and copy-paste the code from that file into it.
* Remember to save the snippet as a 'Shell Script'
* Just run the script, and the browser should open with thus created wallpaper.
* You will see the word `%clipboard` in these snippets. It's the inbuilt Clipboard variable used by TextExpander.

### Here's how the generated wallpapers look like:
